# Solana Migration - Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Revenue Share Toggle - HIDDEN
**Environment Variable Added:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REVENUE_SHARE=false
```

**What's Hidden When `false`:**
- ✅ Admin Sidebar:
  - "Community Payouts" link
  - "Pending Reveals" link  
  - "Mint Admin" link
  - "UTXO Tester" link
  - "ME Wallet Checker" link
  - "Payout Testing" link
  - "Bitcoin (BTC)" transactions link

- ✅ Global Footer:
  - "Revenue Share" link
  - "Pass Details" link

**What's Still Visible:**
- ✅ Solana (SOL) transactions
- ✅ Launchpad features
- ✅ Collections
- ✅ Marketplace
- ✅ Buy Credits

### 2. Wallet Address Updates
- ✅ "Creator Payment Wallet (BTC Address)" → "Creator Payment Wallet (Solana Address)"
- ✅ Placeholder: "bc1q..." → "Your Solana wallet address (e.g., D3SNZ...GiLJ)"
- ✅ Validation message updated

### 3. Launch Mode Descriptions Updated

**Launchpad Mode:**
- ✅ "inscribe on mint" → "mint NFTs"
- ✅ "Automated inscription" → "Automated minting"

**Self-Inscribe → Self-Mint:**
- ✅ "Self-Inscribe" → "Self-Mint"
- ✅ "Inscribe your collection using tapscript" → "Mint your collection using Metaplex"
- ✅ "Batch inscriptions" → "Batch minting"
- ✅ "inscription process" → "minting process"

**Marketplace:**
- ✅ "for bitcoin or credits" → "for SOL or credits"
- ✅ "Never inscribe it yourself" → "Never mint it yourself"

### 4. Mint Type Labels Updated
- ✅ "Ordinals Hidden Mint" → "🎲 Mystery Mint"
- ✅ "random ordinal assignment" → "random NFT assignment"
- ✅ "Ordinal Choices Mint" → "🎯 Choose Your NFT"
- ✅ "users select specific ordinals" → "users select specific NFTs"

## 🔄 Remaining Updates (Not Critical)

### Variable Names (Internal - Low Priority)
The agent found ~80 internal variable references that could be updated:
- `ordinal_number` → `nft_number` or `token_number`
- `inscription_id` → `mint_id` or `nft_id`
- `allOrdinals` → `allNFTs`
- Various `ordinal` → `nft` in loops

**Recommendation:** Leave these for now since they work fine and changing them requires extensive testing. Focus on user-facing text only.

### API Endpoints (Internal - Low Priority)
- `/api/collections/${id}/ordinals` → could become `/api/collections/${id}/nfts`
- `/api/collections/${id}/ordinals/check-sizes` → could become `/api/collections/${id}/nfts/check-sizes`

**Recommendation:** Keep current endpoints for backwards compatibility.

### Database Schema (Keep As-Is)
- `mint_inscriptions` table name
- `inscription_id` columns
- `ordinal_id` columns

**Recommendation:** Do NOT rename database columns/tables. Too risky and unnecessary since they work fine internally.

## Configuration Changes Required

### Environment Variables

**Added to `.env` and `.env.local`:**
```bash
# Solana Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=1979a78a-acf5-48e8-b68d-5256535a84ee
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=1979a78a-acf5-48e8-b68d-5256535a84ee
SOL_PAYMENT_ADDRESS=5evWF4HACa6fomaEzXS4UtCogR6S9R5nh1PLgm6dEFZK

# Feature Toggles  
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REVENUE_SHARE=false
```

### To Enable Revenue Share (if needed):
Set to `true` in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REVENUE_SHARE=true
```

Then restart the dev server.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Bitcoin/Ordinals):
- "BTC Address"
- "Inscribe collection"
- "Ordinals Hidden Mint"
- "Batch inscriptions"
- "for bitcoin"

### After (Solana/NFTs):
- "Solana Address"
- "Mint collection"
- "Mystery Mint"
- "Batch minting"
- "for SOL"

## Testing Checklist

After restart, verify:
- [ ] Revenue share links hidden in admin sidebar
- [ ] Revenue share links hidden in footer
- [ ] Bitcoin transactions link hidden
- [ ] Collection settings show "Solana Address"
- [ ] Launch modes say "mint" not "inscribe"
- [ ] Mint types say "NFT" not "ordinal"
- [ ] Marketplace says "SOL" not "bitcoin"

## Important Notes

### 1. Code Still Works
All the internal variable names and API endpoints still reference "ordinals" and "inscriptions" but this is fine - they're just internal identifiers.

### 2. Database Unchanged
The database schema still has Bitcoin-era names (mint_inscriptions, ordinal_id, etc.) but this is intentional - no need to rename.

### 3. Focus on UX
The goal was to update user-facing terminology only, which is now complete for the most visible areas.

### 4. Revenue Share Preserved
All revenue share code is still in the codebase, just hidden via environment variable. Can be re-enabled anytime by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REVENUE_SHARE=true`.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `.env` and `.env.local` - Added ENABLE_REVENUE_SHARE
2. ✅ `components/admin-sidebar.tsx` - Conditional revenue share links
3. ✅ `components/global-footer.tsx` - Conditional revenue share links
4. ✅ `app/collections/[id]/launch/components/CollectionSettingsStep.tsx` - Solana address, NFT terminology
5. ✅ `app/collections/[id]/launch/components/LaunchModeSelector.tsx` - Mint/NFT terminology
6. ✅ `app/collections/[id]/launch/page.tsx` - Solana address validation

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to update the remaining ~70 internal variable references:
1. Update LaunchStep.tsx (most ordinal references)
2. Update type definitions in types.ts
3. Update API endpoint names
4. Update database column names (not recommended)

But for now, the user-facing experience is fully Solana-focused! 🎉

## To Apply Changes

**Restart your dev server:**
```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

Then test:
- Admin sidebar (no revenue share links)
- Footer (no revenue share links)
- Collection launch (shows Solana terminology)
